Hello <%= badguy["name"].split(" ").first%>,

Here at Time Enforcement Commission, our records indicate that you haven't turned in your time sheet for the week ending <%= deadline.strftime("%b %-d, %Y") %>. Upstanding citizens such as yourself have nothing to worry about since there's nearly <%= hours_before_late %> hours left before it's overdue. Remember that time sheets are due at 6pm every Monday!
