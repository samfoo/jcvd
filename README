Ruby 1.9.2. App assumes use of rvm. 
1. You must be on the Chi TW VPN or twdata wifi or office ethernet.

3. export your Active Directory password as an environment variable (example: export TWPASS=yourpass)
4. Make test file testdata.json containing a line like {"name":"Your Name","email":"your_email@domain.com","mobile":"1111111111"} # each entry must be all on one line
5. gem install bundle ; bundle install
6. bundle exec ./jcvd --email --sms --call testdata.json # this contacts all people in the testdata file via email, sms, and phonecall.  
7. bundle exec ./tec # this tests the data retrieval capability. You might not have access to Peoplesoft.
